# CardMirror

CardMirror is a debate text editor focused on high school and college
policy debate. It's a standalone
replacement for the editor side of
**[Verbatim](https://github.com/ashtarcommunications/verbatim)**, the
Microsoft Word add-in most US debate teams use: same organizational structure, 
same F-key shortcuts, same send-to-speech
workflow, same Word-compatible `.docx` files — but with no Word, no
macros, and no add-in. That keeps it fast on the multi-megabyte
evidence files debaters work in, and enables cross-platform feature parity.

Run it as a **desktop app** for tournament-day work, or as a **web
preview** in any browser for trying it out or working from a Chromebook
or locked-down school machine.

> **Keep backups.** CardMirror is stable and used daily, but no
> editor is bug-free — keep a copy of anything critical in a second
> format.
>
> **Desktop builds are unsigned**, so Windows and macOS warn you the
> first time you launch. The one-time workaround for each is in the
> install steps below.

## Sharing relay status

[![Sharing relay status](https://uptime.betterstack.com/status-badges/v2/monitor/2xdk0.svg)](https://cardmirror.betteruptime.com/)

Card sharing and collaboration sessions go through a small relay server.
If sharing seems broken, check the live status page at
**[cardmirror.betteruptime.com](https://cardmirror.betteruptime.com/)**
before troubleshooting on your end. Everything else in CardMirror works
offline and does not depend on it.

## Support

The core CardMirror editor is free, and built and maintained by one
person. If it's useful to you, two ways to help keep it going:

- **Subscribe at [Debate Decoded](https://debate-decoded.ghost.io/)** —
  recurring support that funds ongoing development, and the best way to
  keep the project moving.
- **[Tip once on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/anthonytrufanov)** — a
  one-time contribution, no account needed. (Or use the **Sponsor**
  button at the top of the repo.)

## Install

Desktop builds live on the [Releases page](https://github.com/ant981228/cardmirror/releases).
Pick the file for your operating system, run the installer, and
launch CardMirror like any other app.

### macOS

1. Download `CardMirror-x.x.x-universal.dmg` — one download that runs
   natively on both Apple Silicon (M1 and later) and Intel Macs.
2. Open the `.dmg`, drag **CardMirror** to your Applications folder.
3. **First launch only.** Gatekeeper refuses to open unsigned apps.
   You'll see one of two messages depending on your macOS version:

   - **"can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious
     software"** → Open Finder → Applications, **right-click** (or
     Control-click) **CardMirror** → **Open**. Click **Open** in the
     confirmation dialog. From then on, normal double-click works.

   - **"is damaged and can't be opened"** → macOS has hard-quarantined
     the app and the right-click workaround doesn't suffice. Open a
     terminal (Spotlight → "Terminal") and run:
     ```sh
     sudo xattr -cr /Applications/CardMirror.app
     ```
     You'll be asked for your password. After that, normal
     double-click works.

### Windows

1. Download `CardMirror Setup x.x.x.exe`.
2. Run the installer (Next → Install → Finish).
3. **First launch only.** SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your
   PC." Click **More info** → **Run anyway**.

### Linux

Two options for installation, depending upon distribution:

- **AppImage** (works on every modern distro): download
  `cardmirror-x.x.x.AppImage`. In a terminal, in the download
  folder, run:
  ```sh
  chmod +x cardmirror-x.x.x.AppImage
  ./cardmirror-x.x.x.AppImage
  ```
  For most graphical desktop environments with modern file managers, you should
  be able to run the AppImage by double-clicking after the `chmod +x` command.

- **Arch and Arch-based distributions** — use the AUR:
  ```sh
  yay -S cardmirror-bin
  # or with paru: paru -S cardmirror-bin
  ```
  Or grab `cardmirror-x.x.x.pacman` from the release directly and:
  ```sh
  sudo pacman -U cardmirror-x.x.x.pacman
  ```

### Web app (Chromebook & browser)

No download needed — open the
[live web app](https://cardmirror.app/) in a Chromium browser
(Chrome, Edge, or ChromeOS) and click the **Install** button in the address bar
to run CardMirror in its own window, offline, updating itself on relaunch. On a
Chromebook this is the way to run it — no desktop build required.

Installed, the web app does most of what the desktop editions do: **save in
place** and autosave (it may ask for permission to edit each file),
one-keystroke **Paste Text**, **multiple windows** (New Document / New Speech
Document open their own window) with the dropzone, Quick Cards, and send-to-speech
kept in sync across them, the **three-pane workspace**, and single-file **Clean /
Convert / Compress** tools on the home screen.

Still desktop-only: background file-library search, folder-wide bulk operations,
Send to Verbatim Flow, voice control, card sharing, and real-time **co-editing**
(share a document and edit it together live — experimental). Firefox and Safari run the
editor but lack the File System Access API, so there Save falls back to a
download. See **[Desktop vs. web](./MANUAL.md#desktop-vs-web)** in the manual for
the full breakdown.

> **Web feels slow on big documents? Check your extensions.** Some browser
> extensions — password managers (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden) and form
> fillers especially — rescan the whole page every time you focus a text box,
> which can freeze the editor for a second or more on a large file. The desktop
> app never hits this because it loads no extensions. To confirm, open the app
> in an Incognito window (extensions are off there) — if it's snappy, an
> extension is the cause. To fix it without turning the extension off
> everywhere, tell Chrome to run it only on this site by request: click the
> **puzzle-piece (Extensions)** icon in the toolbar, click the **⋮** next to the
> extension, and set **"This can read and change site data" → "When you click
> the extension."**

### Updates

**Help → Check for Updates…** checks manually: it tells you you're
current, or announces an available update and downloads it in the
background.

CardMirror also checks for updates automatically — silently at launch
and once a day, speaking up only when a new version is actually ready.
Turn this off (or pause it for a week — handy at a tournament) in
Settings → General → "About this install" → **Check for updates
automatically**.

Updates never interrupt you: when a new version has finished
downloading, a small chip appears in the status bar ("Update x.y.z
ready — restart to install"), and nothing installs until you click it.
On Windows and Linux, quitting the app normally also applies a
downloaded update on the way out. On macOS, clicking the chip restarts
straight into the new version; if your install can't be updated in
place (for example the app isn't in a writable folder), the chip opens
the releases page instead so you can grab the new `.dmg`.

Going to a tournament? **Pause update checks for 1 week** (Settings →
General → "About this install") stops all automatic checks and
downloads until the shown resume date.

Linux users who installed via the AUR can update with `yay -Syu`
instead.

## (Optional) Set up AI features

A few features call out to an AI model:

- AI-formatted citations from a pasted URL or freeform quote.
- AI repair of OCR / PDF extraction errors in a selection (Mod-Shift-R).
- AI image alt-text and table-from-image (right-click an image).
- AI commenting / explain features in the comments column.

Two providers are supported; pick either one:

- **Anthropic** (the default) talks directly to Anthropic's Claude
  API. Get an API key from
  [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) (you'll
  need to top up a small amount of credit — Anthropic doesn't have
  a free tier for the API).
- **OpenRouter** talks to [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/),
  which fronts models from many labs behind one key — use it if you
  already have OpenRouter credit or want a specific non-Claude
  model. You choose the model by its id (e.g.
  `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` or `openai/gpt-4o`) in the
  **OpenRouter model** field.

To enable them:

1. Get an API key from the provider you picked.
2. In CardMirror, click the ⚙ gear icon in the ribbon.
3. Toggle **AI features** on, choose your provider under
   **AI provider**, and paste your key into that provider's key
   field (**Anthropic API key** or **OpenRouter API key**).

The key is stored locally on your machine and is sent directly to
the provider you picked when you trigger an AI feature. It doesn't
travel through a third-party server.

**Translation** (Mod-Shift-T on a selection → copied to the clipboard)
also has an Anthropic backend, but it works **without** any AI setup: the
default MyMemory backend needs no key. You can also plug in a Google Cloud
Translation key. Configure it under Settings → Editing → Translation.

## Run from source

You only need this if you want to **build CardMirror yourself**
(contribute, run a development branch, or use the editor on a
platform we don't publish binaries for). For day-to-day use,
download a release above.

### 1. Install Node.js

CardMirror is built with JavaScript / TypeScript and needs **Node.js**
to run. Node is a regular desktop installer.

- **macOS** — open [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) in your browser
  and click the blue **"LTS"** download button. Open the `.pkg`
  file from Downloads and click through the installer.
- **Windows** — open [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and click the
  blue **"LTS"** download button. Open the `.msi` file from
  Downloads and click through the installer.
- **Linux** — the easiest path is the official installer at
  [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) — pick
  your distro and follow the few commands it shows.

You don't need to verify the install — if the next step works, Node
is installed.

### 2. Download the source

1. Open
   [the CardMirror page on GitHub](https://github.com/ant981228/cardmirror)
   in your browser.
2. Click the **green `<> Code` button** near the top of the file list.
3. Click **"Download ZIP"** at the bottom of the dropdown.
4. Unzip the download. You'll get a folder called
   **`cardmirror-main`**. Move it somewhere you can find later —
   your Desktop or Documents is fine.
5. **Open the `cardmirror-main` folder and look inside.** Some
   unzippers double-wrap. You want the folder that directly
   contains `package.json`, `README.md`, `index.html`, and `src/`
   — if you only see another `cardmirror-main` folder, that's the
   wrapper; open it.

### 3. Open a terminal inside that folder

A "terminal" is a window where you type commands. You're going to
open one already pointing at the CardMirror folder.

- **macOS** — enable Finder → right-click → *Services → New
  Terminal at Folder* once via System Settings → Keyboard →
  Keyboard Shortcuts → Services → Files and Folders, then
  right-click the folder.
- **Windows** — open File Explorer in the folder, click the address
  bar, type `cmd`, press Enter.
- **Linux** — right-click inside the folder and pick *Open Terminal
  Here* (Nautilus / Dolphin / Thunar all offer it), or open in terminal and
  `cd` to the filepath.

To make sure you're in the right directory, type `ls` (macOS / Linux)
or `dir` (Windows) and press Enter. You should see `package.json`,
`README.md`, `src`, `apps`. If you don't, your terminal is likely one
folder too high up — verify your current folder with the `pwd` command
(macOS / Linux / Windows PowerShell) or by typing `echo %cd%` (Windows, non-PowerShell).

### 4. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Downloads everything CardMirror needs. Takes 30 seconds to a couple
of minutes. Deprecation warnings are normal; only red `error` lines
indicate trouble.

### 5. Run the web edition

```sh
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser.

### Run the desktop edition (from source)

```sh
npm run desktop:dev
```

This builds the Electron main process, starts the Vite dev server,
and launches the desktop window. Same code, same renderer — but in
a native window with file-system access.

### Coming back later

Open a terminal in the same folder; run `npm run dev` (or
`npm run desktop:dev`) again. To pick up newer code, download a
fresh ZIP and rerun `npm install` in it.

## Other commands

These all run inside the terminal pointed at the CardMirror folder
(same setup as the install steps above):

```
npm test            # run all tests
npm run test:bench  # performance benchmarks
npm run typecheck   # strict TypeScript check
```

### Testing round-trip against your own .docx files

The round-trip test suite and the round-trip benchmark both walk a
folder of `.docx` fixtures and run universal preservation checks on
each one (text length, heading IDs, mark counts, indent / spacing
multisets, etc.). Point them at any folder by setting
`CARDMIRROR_DOCS_DIR`:

```
CARDMIRROR_DOCS_DIR="/path/to/your/docx/files" npm test
CARDMIRROR_DOCS_DIR="/path/to/your/docx/files" npm run test:bench
```

When the variable isn't set, the suite looks under
`reference-docs/example docs/` (the project owner's local corpus).
When that folder doesn't exist either — the default state on a fresh
clone — the file-dependent tests skip cleanly and the rest of the
suite still runs.

## Round-trip a docx

The CLI imports a Verbatim/Advanced-Verbatim docx, normalizes it through
our schema, and re-exports a fresh docx:

```sh
npm run round-trip path/to/input.docx [path/to/output.docx]
```

The output is fully native to Verbatim — same canonical style ids, same
direct-formatting conventions. Stylepox and other non-Verbatim cruft is
dropped on import (per [`ARCHITECTURE.md §3`](./ARCHITECTURE.md)).

## Public API

```ts
import {
  schema,        // the ProseMirror schema
  fromDocx,      // .docx bytes → ProseMirror doc
  toDocx,        // ProseMirror doc → .docx bytes
  exportDoc,     // schema doc → { documentXml, relsXml }
  importDoc,     // document.xml → schema doc
  newHeadingId,  // generate a fresh stable heading UUID
} from 'cardmirror';
```

### Example: read a docx, modify, write it back

```ts
import { fromDocx, toDocx } from 'cardmirror';
import { readFile, writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

const buf = await readFile('input.docx');
const doc = await fromDocx(buf);

// `doc` is a ProseMirror Node — walk it, transform it, edit it...
console.log(`${doc.nodeSize} chars in tree`);

const out = await toDocx(doc);
await writeFile('output.docx', out);
```

### Schema highlights

```
doc:        sequence of block-level kinds
pocket:     Heading 1 paragraph (with stable id)
hat:        Heading 2 paragraph (with stable id)
block:      Heading 3 paragraph (with stable id)
card:       structured: tag (card_body | undertag | cite_paragraph | analytic | table)*
tag:        Heading 4 (only inside card)
cite_paragraph, card_body: body paragraphs inside cards
analytic:   outline-4 paragraph (Analytic style; can be standalone or in-card)
undertag:   Undertag-styled paragraph
paragraph:  unstyled body text (first-class — can sit between any nodes)
table:      table_row+ (at doc level OR inside a card / analytic_unit)
table_row:  (table_cell | table_header)+
table_cell: paragraph+
image:      inline atom (base64 bytes + EMU dimensions + alt; round-trips through .docx)
```

Every paragraph-like textblock carries round-trip-only attrs
`indent` (left indent in OOXML dxa) and `spacing` (verbatim
`<w:spacing>` map). Tables carry `rawTblPr` (table-level borders /
style / shading captured opaquely); cells carry `rawTcPr`
(per-cell borders, shading, vAlign).

Marks: `cite_mark`, `underline_mark`, `underline_direct`,
`emphasis_mark`, `undertag_mark`, `analytic_mark`, plus direct
formatting `bold`, `italic`, `strikethrough`, `superscript`,
`subscript`, `link`, `highlight`, `font_color`, `font_size`,
`shading`, `pilcrow_marker`, `font_family`, `comment_range`
(anchors a thread to a range of text).

See [`src/schema/`](./src/schema/) for full specs and
[`ARCHITECTURE.md §4`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for design rationale.

## Plugin API (experimental)

The desktop app can load plugins — one GitHub repo per plugin,
publishing a manifest + built bundle as release assets. A plugin
registers commands that appear in the command palette, the keybindings
editor, and the printed shortcut reference like native ones, and can
extract structured card data from the current selection, jump back to
a card's source, and exchange messages with companion apps (such as a
flowing app) over the local **cardmirror-bridge** — a loopback HTTP
handshake, never the network.

Two things to know before writing one:

- **Plugins are full-trust code.** They run inside the editor with the
  same access the editor has, so installs are limited to a curated
  allowlist (served by the relay; self-hosted relay operators curate
  their own via `RELAY_PLUGIN_ALLOWLIST`). For development, use
  "Load plugin from file…" in Settings → Plugins, or unlock arbitrary
  repos with `__plugins('community-on')` in the developer console.
- **The plugin-facing API surface is a draft** (a sandboxed v2 may
  change it); the bridge handshake and HTTP routes are frozen.

The full contract — manifest fields, install flow, the capability API,
and the bridge protocol — lives in
[`reference-docs/cardmirror-plugin-api.md`](./reference-docs/cardmirror-plugin-api.md).

## Acknowledgements

CardMirror is built on [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/), the
modular rich-text editor framework created and maintained by
[Marijn Haverbeke](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/). Nearly every editor
primitive CardMirror leans on — the schema-validated transactions,
the typed-tree document model, NodeViews, plugin state, the keymap
and history modules — is ProseMirror's.

The idea to use ProseMirror, as well as credit for dozens of course-corrections along the way, belongs to [text editor wizard Slim Lim](https://slim.computer/). 

If you're curious how ProseMirror works under the hood,
[Marijn's launch post](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/prosemirror-1.html)
is the best high-level introduction, and
[the ProseMirror docs](https://prosemirror.net/docs/) cover the
APIs in depth.

Thank you to Marijn and the ProseMirror community for the years of
careful library design that made this project tractable. If
ProseMirror has been useful to you too, Marijn's work is supported
directly at <https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/fund/>.

CardMirror's voice control was shaped by ideas pioneered in the
hands-free-editing community — [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/),
[Cursorless](https://www.cursorless.org/), and
[Pokey Rule](https://github.com/pokey).

Features and code have been contributed by
[Shreeram Modi](https://github.com/shreerammodi),
[Q Cooper](https://github.com/mosuqc),
[cora](https://github.com/coralynnkc), and
[Neo Cai](https://github.com/caineoyuan). Each contribution is
credited where it shipped in the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

Special thanks to Q Cooper and Missouri State debate for beta
testing.
